Git basics, github basics, python error basics!! Let's get hacking on GroundStation :)


1. Git Basics/Github
- Creating a GH account
- getting access to the lab repository
- This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ-qvsxPHpY&pp=ygUPZ2l0IGZvciBkdW1taWVz)
- play with repo with stuff learned in the video
- go a little deeper with git branch to allow project contribution

2. Python Error Handling
- Why error handling matters
- try/catch/except blocks of code
- how we can use it in groundStation
- play with [this file](https://github.com/nathansamuell/Lab-Oct-3/blob/main/error_handling.py) first
- play with it on groundStation code in a guided manner, as well as make our first commits to the repository!
